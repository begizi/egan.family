Brian planned the first date and kept it a secret until we arrived at the go-kart racing track. Though Alex is not a fan of fast moving, adrenaline inducing activities, she put on a brave face just for him. Now that he knows her, he won’t be taking her on those types of dates anymore. In May, we welcomed Bella, our first puppy, into our family. By August of 2014 we set off on our first big adventure. 8 days in a moving truck with a 6-month-old puppy. Destination: Providence, Rhode Island. Brian started his first official job as a software engineer, and Alex quickly moved up the ranks of Starbucks and became a store manager. In December of 2015 we welcomed our second puppy into our family, Luna. In our free time, we would travel near and far.

We walked through a rainforest until we saw the giant rock formation. After climbing up the stairs into the bridge we found a meadow on the other side with large boulders. We decided to investigate. Brian quickly set up a time lapse on the GoPro to capture our exploration. As we walked up to the rocks we found fossils of shells and small creatures. We took a second to admire the scene around us, and then Brian turned and looked at Alex. That’s when time stood still.

On December 31st, three years to the day that we met, we set out on a walk along the beach in Greymouth, New Zealand. It was a rainy day, but we were determined to enjoy the beach as much as we could. Before we got back to our campsite we stopped and watched the waves washing over the pebbles on the beach, we watched a kiwi bird run past us and into the clearing behind us, and for a second the rain subsided.

This time to Mountain View, California. The unexpected move changed our original wedding plans. In classic Alex and Brian fashion, as we discussed the changes we made a joke that we should just get married right away. That joke turned into light planning. Which then turned into a fully formed idea. When it was officially decided that we would get married, we had 48 days to plan our ceremony. So, we called our immediate families, and said, “First, we aren’t pregnant.” then made sure they could attend if we pulled it off. We were married in an intimate, elopement style ceremony up by a lake in central oregon.
