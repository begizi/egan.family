    <h2>Will there be dancing?</h2>
    <p>Of course there will be dancing! We are very excited to get down on the dance floor with our closest friends and family.</p>

    <h2>Is there a registry?</h2>
    <p>We have been together for quite some time now. Because of this we have everything we need! We did set up a honeymoon fund through Zola if you would like to help us have our dream honeymoon in Costa Rica! The link can be found under the Registry/Our honeymoon tab.</p>

    <h2>I have a question not answered here, how should I contact you?</h2>
    <p>You can email Alex at <a href="mailto:alexjmcclean@gmail.com">alexjmcclean@gmail.com</a> or message her on Facebook or Instagram.</p>

    <h2>I’m in Bend for a few days, what should I do?</h2>
    <p>
      If you like hiking, hanging out at the lake, and generally exploring the outdoors, this is the place! Wander up the Cascade Lakes Highway and stop along the many different lakes and hiking trails. I would suggest stopping at Sparks Lake if you are looking for a great lake and want to see where Brian and I got married.
      <br /> <br />
      Bend, Oregon is famous for it’s many micro-breweries. Hang out in downtown Bend and walk to Ale Trail! Download the app to find the different breweries, and stamp the passport! After 10 breweries you can get a Bend Ale Trail silipint, and after 16 breweries you get a Bend Ale Trail bottle opener.
      <br /> <br />
      And of course, check out some of the local coffee shops. Thump Coffee, Backporch Coffee Roasters, and Strictly Organic are a few of my favorites.
